# Growfoundry OSS Instructions

## What Growfoundry OSS Does

Backend-as-a-service with database, authentication, and file storage. 

**Key Concept**: GrowFoundry replaces your traditional backend - implement business logic by calling database operations directly. Instead of building API endpoints, use our database API as your application's backend.

## 🚨 Project Setup

**Create your app in a NEW directory, not inside `growfoundry/`**

The `growfoundry/` directory is the BaaS platform. Your app should live elsewhere:
```
~/projects/
├── growfoundry/      # ← BaaS platform (don't work here)
└── my-app/        # ← Your new app (work here)
```

## When to Use Tools

**MUST DO FIRST** → Download project rules: `download-project-rules`
**Start here** → `get-backend-metadata` (shows current database state)
**Need docs** → `get-db-api`, `get-auth-api`, or `get-storage-api`
**Create table** → `create-table` with explicit schema
**Work with data** → Use database API endpoints directly

## Critical Rule: 
**MUST DO FIRST** → Call`download-project-rules` to download project rules

## Critical Rule: Check Metadata First

Before ANY database operation, call `get-backend-metadata` to get the current database state.

## Standard Workflow

1. **Always** call `get-backend-metadata` first
2. Check `get-instructions` if unfamiliar with the system
3. Create tables with `create-table` if needed
4. Use database API to insert/query/update/delete records
5. Call `get-backend-metadata` again to verify changes

## Key Rules

- Frequently check `get-instructions` and `get-backend-metadata`
- Always define explicit table schemas (no assumptions)
- Every table gets auto ID, created_at, updated_at fields
- **Database operations require**: JWT token (Authorization: Bearer header)
- **API keys are for MCP testing** (use tokens for production)
- File uploads work automatically with multipart/form-data

## Authentication Requirements

### Database Operations Need Authentication Token:
1. **JWT Token**: `Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token` - Authenticates the user

**Important Note about API Keys:**
- The `x-api-key` header is ONLY used for MCP (Model Context Protocol) testing
- Production applications should NEVER use API keys
- Always use JWT tokens from user/admin authentication for real applications

Without the Bearer token, you'll get "permission denied" errors when trying to insert, update, or delete records.

### Getting Authentication:
```bash
# Works on both Windows and Unix (Windows PowerShell: use curl.exe)
# 1. First login to get JWT token
curl -X POST http://localhost:7130/api/auth/admin/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"username\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"your-password\"}"

# Response includes token: {"accessToken": "eyJ...", "projectAdmin": {...}}

# Works on both Windows and Unix (Windows PowerShell: use curl.exe)
# 2. Use the auth token for database operations
curl -X POST http://localhost:7130/api/database/records/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "[{\"name\": \"Product\", \"price\": 99.99}]"
```

## Example: Comment Upvoting Feature

- Check current tables: `get-backend-metadata`
- Create comment_votes table: `create-table` with user_id, comment_id, vote_type fields
- Frontend upvote action: `POST /api/database/records/comment_votes` with vote data
- Frontend display scores: `GET /api/database/records/comment_votes?comment_id=eq.123` to count votes
- No separate backend needed - frontend calls GrowFoundry database API directly


## Critical Rule: Test API Endpoints with curl

After creating or modifying any API endpoint, always test it with curl to verify it works correctly.

**Note:** Avoid special characters (!,$,`,\) in curl command data - they can cause bash interpretation issues. Use simple text for testing:

```bash
# Works on both Windows and Unix (Windows PowerShell: use curl.exe)
# Example: Test creating a record (requires JWT token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:7130/api/database/records/posts \
  -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{\"title\": \"Test Post\", \"content\": \"Test content\"}]'

# Works on both Windows and Unix (Windows PowerShell: use curl.exe)
# Example: Test querying records (requires both API key and JWT token)
curl http://localhost:7130/api/database/records/posts?id=eq.123 \
  -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token"

# Works on both Windows and Unix (Windows PowerShell: use curl.exe)
# Example: Test authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:7130/api/auth/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{\"email\": \"test@example.com\", \"password\": \"testpass123\"}'
```

Always include:
- **Both headers for database operations**: x-api-key AND Authorization: Bearer token
- Correct HTTP method (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- Valid JSON payload for POST/PATCH requests (remember: POST requires array format `[{...}]`)
- Query parameters for filtering GET requests
- Prefer: return=representation header if you want to see the created/updated records
